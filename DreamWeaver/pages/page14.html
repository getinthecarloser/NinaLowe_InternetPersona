                <p>     <span style="color: #9C9B9B">The firefighter walked up to the policeman  after they had gotten the fire under control. Officer Colby was looking up at  the blackened apartment building with his notepad out ready to get the  information for the report. </span></p>
                <p><br>
                  <span style="color: #FB2C2F">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tragedy really, four of them died  tonight,&rdquo;</span> <span style="color: #9C9B9B">said the firefighter.</span> <span style="color: #FB2C2F">&ldquo;All of them under 18.&rdquo;</span> <span style="color: #9C9B9B">The firefighters were  surrounding the building and comforting the ones who got out in time. To the  right of Officer Colby was a little girl wrapped in a blanket. She was holding  the blanket closed with her Barbie doll in hand. </span></p>
                <p><br>
                  <span style="color: #890AB9">&ldquo;How did it start?&rdquo;</span> <span style="color: #9C9B9B">asked the officer. The  firefighter looked down at the little girl.</span></p>
                <p><br>
                  <span style="color: #FB2C2F">&ldquo;It started in one of the apartments; we  have reason to believe it was a stove top fire,&rdquo;</span> <span style="color: #9C9B9B">he replied.</span> <span style="color: #FB2C2F">&ldquo;It took down one  of the walls between the apartments into a young teen&rsquo;s room. He didn&rsquo;t  survive.&rdquo;</span> <span style="color: #9C9B9B">A woman was telling him earlier that she heard an explosion and she  rushed to her son&rsquo;s room but it was too late. He was then told by a young man  that the fire spread from that apartment to his own. His brother and sister  were visiting for the weekend and they were caught in the smoke. </span></p>
                <p><br>
                  &ldquo;May they be in a better place,&rdquo; <span style="color: #9C9B9B">said the  policeman.</span></p>
