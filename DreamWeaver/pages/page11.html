                <p>     Evan woke up without being able to breath.  She felt like she couldn&rsquo;t get enough air in her lungs like there was a heavy  weight on her chest. She looked down to see that Nik moved closer in the night  and used her as his pillow. </p>
                <p><br>
                  <span style="color: #2D36D5">&ldquo;Get  off me,&rdquo;</span><span style="color: #9C9B9B"> she grumbled through her teeth as she lifted his head and pushed it to  the dirt. </span></p>
                <p><br>
                  <span style="color: #09BF1E">&ldquo;Ow! Was that necessary?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p><br>
                  <span style="color: #2D36D5">&ldquo;Shit, guys look, the smoke is deeper into  the forest. We&rsquo;ve got to move!&rdquo; </span><span style="color: #9C9B9B">said Evan. She moved towards Elliot and Cleo  and gave them little nudges to wake them up. They both looked confused. Nik  just pointed towards the smoke and they both jumped up and knew what was going  on. They started running deeper into the forest staying close together. </span></p>
                <p><br>
                  <span style="color: #09BF1E">&ldquo;How do you know where to go?&rdquo;</span><span style="color: #9C9B9B"> Nikolai  asked while breathing heavily. </span></p>
                <p><br>
                  <span style="color: #2D36D5">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, I just know we have to keep  moving away from that,&rdquo;</span> <span style="color: #9C9B9B">she replied, pointing her chin briefly behind her. They  reached the other side of the forest but there was no real way out. The edge of  the treeline was right next to a rock face. Evan worked her way to the right  and brought them to an opening in the rock. Nikolai recognized the cave as the  place he used to explore when he was ten, with his friend Thomas. Before he  moved in with his mom, he lived next to Cross Pike Mountain with his dad. He  didn&rsquo;t realize those were the woods they were in.</span></p>
