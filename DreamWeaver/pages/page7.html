                <p>	<span style="color: #222222">.....</span><span style="color: #9C9B9B">Cleo  led them to a clearing in the forest where the leaves on the ground were  flattened in a perfect circle as if an alien spaceship had landed there moments  earlier. She told them this is the spot she used to camp with her family. Evan  and Elliot both used to camp in these woods as well with their parents and  older brother Tate. Elliot started a fire to cook up the prairie dogs and they  all settled around it. The mixture of the smoke and the roasting of the animals  made an awful smell that Cleo found familiar. Staring into the fire, the sun  having fully set, she thought back to the day the smoke arrived. </span></p>
                <p><br>
                  Cleo&rsquo;s little sister Anabel had been  playing with her dolls in the living room. Her parents were gone to a meeting  with the bank and she was in charge of making dinner for Anabel and herself.  She had done it many times before and today she was going to make chicken and  rice. It was her sister&rsquo;s favorite meal and her mom never thought to make it.  The rice had been cooking in the rice cooker for a bit and she was now going to  put the chicken in a skillet.  She picked  the slimy uncooked chicken up and placed it in the hot pan. While she was  wiping her hands off on a towel Anabel attempted to put one of the Barbie&rsquo;s  shoes in her mouth. Rushing to make sure her sister didn&rsquo;t choke, Cleo threw  the towel down quickly. She took the Barbie&rsquo;s shoe out of Anabel&rsquo;s hand and  took the other shoe off the Barbie for good measure. Then she smelt smoke and  her eyes began to water. Cleo rapidly turned to look at the chicken. The  chicken wasn&rsquo;t burning but the towel she threw down had caught fire. Cleo  rushed back over to turn the stove off and then find the apartment&rsquo;s fire  extinguisher, but when she got to the stove she heard a pop and felt the  burning of the sun in her face. The very next second her face cooled down and  she opened her eyes to see the stove had disappeared and all the rooms behind  the kitchen were gone. All she saw was gray and a smoky substance filled the  air.  She heard Anabel from behind her. </p>
