                <p>     &ldquo;Cleo!&rdquo; <span style="color: #9C9B9B">Elliot said for the fourth time,  thrusting some meat forward. Cleo looked away from the fire and up at Elliot  holding the unappetizing slice of charred animal. Cleo shook her head and said  no thank you.  Elliot sat down next to  her with his portion of prairie dog and began biting into it like he hadn&rsquo;t  eaten in weeks. </span></p>
                <p><br>
                  <span style="color: #2D36D5">&ldquo;Aw Elliot that&rsquo;s so gross,&rdquo;</span> <span style="color: #9C9B9B">said Evan.  She picked up a handful of leaves at her foot and tossed them in Elliot&rsquo;s face.  Nikolai was sitting cross legged on the opposite side of the fire. His eyes  widened and Evan turned her head to see what he was looking at behind them. The  smoke was back and was consuming the trees, leaves, dirt and everything that  was swept into its shiny cloud.</span></p>
                <p><br>
                  <span style="color: #C4A005">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s advancing at a slower pace than  before,&rdquo;</span> <span style="color: #9C9B9B">Cleo told them.</span> <span style="color: #C4A005">&ldquo;We should be okay here for tonight, but should get moving  early in the morning.&rdquo;</span>  <span style="color: #9C9B9B">She scooched her  bum forward on the log Nikolai had laid down when they got there, and took out  the mini note pad she always kept in her back pocket.</span></p>
                <p> <br>
                  &ldquo;What are you always writing in that  thing?&rdquo; <span style="color: #9C9B9B">asked Elliot leaning over her shoulder to take a look. Cleo turned her  head to look at him as she replied but she didn&rsquo;t realize how close his face  was. She quickly looked back down at her pen. </span></p>
                <p><br>
                  <span style="color: #C4A005">&ldquo;Recording its appearances and patterns  for the scientists if we ever get out of here,&rdquo;</span> <span style="color: #9C9B9B">she said.  Evan chuckled to herself and looked up at  Nik. Nik was looking back at her with a knowing smirk. They had both caught a  glimpse of it when she dropped it that morning and the wind made it hop forward  on the ground. There was a page with a large heart with Elliot&rsquo;s name inside of  it. </span></p>
